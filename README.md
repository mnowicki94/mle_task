Machine Learning Engineer TASK:

Background:
We receive several million documents a year that need to be classified and distributed to the correct
department. To speed up this process, we want to develop a machine learning model to classify
documents automatically.
Since we cannot share real data for this task, we use a substitute data set consisting of news
headlines.


Goal:
1. Build a predictive model to classify headlines into 4 categories (see below)
2. Create a REST API to serve the model
3. Write an example script (Bash or Python) that uses the API from the command line
4. Prepare a presentation of your approach and results.


Data:
The news headlines data set can be found at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00359/NewsAggregatorDataset.zip
This dataset consists of the following columns, delimited by \t:

Column    | Description
id        | Numeric ID
title     | News title (to be classified)
url       | URL of the original article
publisher | Name of the publisher
category  | Category (b for business, t for science and technology, e for entertainment, and m for health)
story     | Alphanumeric id of the cluster that includes news about the same story
hostname  | Hostname
timestamp | Timestamp

Your model does not need to use all attributes. You are free to determine which ones to use and
which to discard (using analysis or your own judgment). It’s also ok to take a data sample instead of
using the entire data set.


Report:
Code: You can include a notebook for your exploratory steps, but the final output should also include
runnable Python code as a Python file or module.
Presentation: Powerpoint, etc.


Evaluation Criteria:
Performance of the final model is not a very important criterion for this exercise; we are more
interested in:

- The step-by-step approach and thought process
- The soundness and robustness of the solution and evaluation metrics
- The quality and clarity of the code. Your Python code should be well formatted and (for
example) contain docstrings.
- Considerations for possible next steps are also welcome (for example if there are things you
would have liked to try if you had had more time)# mle_task

Machine Learning Engineer TASK:

Background:
We receive several million documents a year that need to be classified and distributed to the correct
department. To speed up this process, we want to develop a machine learning model to classify
documents automatically.
Since we cannot share real data for this task, we use a substitute data set consisting of news
headlines.


Goal:
1. Build a predictive model to classify headlines into 4 categories (see below)
2. Create a REST API to serve the model
3. Write an example script (Bash or Python) that uses the API from the command line
4. Prepare a presentation of your approach and results.


Data:
The news headlines data set can be found at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00359/NewsAggregatorDataset.zip
This dataset consists of the following columns, delimited by \t:

Column    | Description
id        | Numeric ID
title     | News title (to be classified)
url       | URL of the original article
publisher | Name of the publisher
category  | Category (b for business, t for science and technology, e for entertainment, and m for health)
story     | Alphanumeric id of the cluster that includes news about the same story
hostname  | Hostname
timestamp | Timestamp

Your model does not need to use all attributes. You are free to determine which ones to use and
which to discard (using analysis or your own judgment). Itâ€™s also ok to take a data sample instead of
using the entire data set.


Report:
Code: You can include a notebook for your exploratory steps, but the final output should also include
runnable Python code as a Python file or module.
Presentation: Powerpoint, etc.


Evaluation Criteria:
Performance of the final model is not a very important criterion for this exercise; we are more
interested in:

- The step-by-step approach and thought process
- The soundness and robustness of the solution and evaluation metrics
- The quality and clarity of the code. Your Python code should be well formatted and (for
example) contain docstrings.
- Considerations for possible next steps are also welcome (for example if there are things you
would have liked to try if you had had more time)# mle_task
